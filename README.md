# Hidden-Gems-of-Ontario
The "Hidden Gems of Ontario" project aims to uncover and showcase the lesser-known attractions, destinations, and experiences in the province of Ontario, Canada. From charming small towns to hidden natural wonders, this project seeks to highlight the unique and off-the-beaten-path places that may not be widely known to tourists or even locals.
